# High Issues

## H-1: Weak Randomness

The use of keccak256 hash functions on predictable values like block.timestamp, block.number, or similar data, including modulo operations on these values, should be avoided for generating randomness, as they are easily predictable and manipulable. The `PREVRANDAO` opcode also should not be used as a source of randomness. Instead, utilize Chainlink VRF for cryptographically secure and provably random values to ensure protocol integrity.

	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

	```solidity
	    function isEggDeposited(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (bool) {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

	```solidity
	        ) % 100;
	```

</details>



## L-5: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event EggWithdrawn(address indexed withdrawer, uint256 tokenId);
	```

</details>



## L-6: Using `ERC721::_mint()` can be dangerous

Using `ERC721::_mint()` can mint ERC721 tokens to addresses which don't support ERC721 tokens. Use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()` for ERC721.

	```solidity
	        _mint(to, tokenId);
	```

</details>



## L-7: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	```

## L-9: State variable could be declared immutable

State variables that are should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor
